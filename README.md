# Netflix
I developed a Netflix clone using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to create a full-featured streaming application. The project integrates Firebase for secure user authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts. On the frontend, React powers a dynamic and responsive interface, while Redux handles state management to ensure a smooth user experience. The backend, built with Node.js and Express, manages API requests and interacts with MongoDB to store user data and movie information, add movies to liked list and remove movies from liked list. This application replicates key Netflix features, including movie browsing, streaming, and user profiles, demonstrating my skills in full-stack development, modern authentication, and state management.
